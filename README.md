pyHyp uses hyperbolic volume mesh marching schemes to extrude structured surface meshes into volume meshes.
pyHyp is used as a preprocessing step in the geometry and mesh-creation process prior to an optimization.

## How pyHyp fits within MACH

pyHyp takes structured surface meshes and extrudes them into structured volume meshes.
This is done as a pre-processing step.
Generally, the surface meshes come from ICEM.
The pyHyp-generated volume meshes are then used in [ADflow](https://github.com/mdolab/adflow) to perform CFD.
An example [XDSM](https://github.com/mdolab/pyXDSM) for an optimization setup that uses pyHyp is shown below.
