Introduction
============

`pyHyp` is hyperbolic mesh generator that is capable of automatically
generating two or three dimensional 3D meshes around simple geometric
configurations. The basic idea is to start with an initial surface (or
line) corresponding to the geometry of interest and then *grow* or
*extrude* the mesh in successive layers until it reaches a sufficient
distance from the original surface. In the process, the entire space
surrounding the geometry is meshed.

Most the theory for `pyHyp` was taken from `Chan and Steger <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/009630039290073A>`_.
