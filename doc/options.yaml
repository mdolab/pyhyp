inputFile:
  desc: >
    Name of the file that contains the surface mesh.
    This is a file that has been generated in an external meshing program, typically ICEMCFD.

patches:
  desc: >
    Explicitly assign arrays of patches as the input surface.

fileType:
  desc: >
    Type of the input file.
  cgns: CGNS format
  plot3d: PLOT3D format
    
skip:
  desc: >
    Flag to entirely skip the grid generation of this geometry.

mode:
  desc: >
    Type of extrusion.
  hyperbolic: Most commonly used
  elliptic: Not typically used

unattachedEdgesAreSymmetry:
  desc: >
    Automatically applies symmetry boundary conditions to any edges that do not interface with another block.
    This option works in many cases but does not work for all surface meshes.
    If you encounter negative volumes near the symmetry plane, try explicitly setting the symmetry boundary conditions using the ``BC`` option.

outerFaceBC:

    Specifies the boundary condition at the outermost face of the extruded mesh.
  farfield: Farfield BC

BC:
  desc: >
    Specifies boundary condition information for specific block edges. See :ref:`here<pyhyp_BC>` for details.

families:
  desc: >
    Name given to wall surfaces.
    If a dictionary is submitted, each wall patch can be named separately.
    This can help with applying operations to specific wall patches.

autoConnect:
  desc: >
    Run cgnsutilities connect function to add any necessary block to block connectivity.

noPointReduce:
  desc: >
    Do not find duplicate nodes along edges.
    This can only be used with single surface input files.

N:
  desc: >
    Number of grid levels to march.
    This determines the grid dimension in the off-wall direction.
    Typically, this should be a "multi-grid" friendly number.

s0:
  desc: >
    Initial off-wall (normal) spacing of grid.
    This is taken to be constant across the entire geometry.
    The units are consistent with the rest of the geometry.

nConstantStart:
  desc: >
    Number of constant off-wall layers before beginning stretch.

nConstantEnd:
  desc: >
    Number of constant layers at the end of the march.

marchDist:
  desc: >
    Distance to march in the normal direction.
    Most wing geometries will have a distance such that the farfield boundary is 10 to 20 span lengths away from the geometry.

nodeTol:
  desc: >
    Tolerance for nodes to be treated as identical.
    
splay:
  desc: >
    Splay BC spreading factor.
    This controls how far the floating edges splay outwards.

splayEdgeOrthogonality:
  desc: >
    How hard to try to force orthogonality at splay edges.
    Should be between 0 and 0.5.

splayCornerOrthogonality:
  desc: >
    How hard to try to force orthogonality at splay corners.

cornerAngle:
  desc: >
    Maximum convex corner angle in degrees necessary to trigger the implicit node averaging scheme.

coarsen:
  desc: >
    Automatically coarsen a surface mesh before starting extrusion.
    ``1`` gives the same surface mesh.
    ``2`` coarsens by a factor of 2 in each direction.
    ``3`` coarsens by a factor of 4 in each direction, and so on.

panelEps:
  desc: >
    Only used in elliptic mode.
    Distance source panels are "below" nodes.
    This parameter usually does not need to be changed.
    
farFieldTolerance:
  desc: >
    Only used in elliptic mode.
    The multiple of the panel length cutoff to use the approximation formula.

useMatrixFree:
  desc: >
    Only used in elliptic mode.
    Use matrix-free solution technique. 
    This is always True when evalMode is ``fast``.

evalMode:
  desc: >
    Only used in elliptic mode.
    Type of panel evaluation routine.
  exact: Modifies the farfield tolerance to ensure that only the exact evaluations are used
  slow: Uses farfield approximations but does not group panels
  fast: Uses farfield approximations and panel groupings

sourceStrengthFile:
  desc: >
    Only used in elliptic mode.
    File to use to load/save the source strengths on the surface.

cMax:
  desc: >
    The maximum permissible ratio of marching direction length to the any other in-plane edge.
    This parameter effectively operates as a CFL-type limit.
    If a step would require a step which would result in a ratio ``c`` greater than ``cMax``, the step is automatically split internally to respect this user-supplied limit.
    Typical values of ``cMax`` are around 6-8.
    Increased robustness can be achieved at the expense of computational cost by lowering ``cMax``.

nonLinear:
  desc: >
    Use the nonlinear formulation.
    This is experimental and not currently recommended and may not work at all.

slExp:
  desc: >
    Exponent for the :math:`S_l` computation.
    The :math:`S_l` value serves the same purpose as found in Chan et al. but the computation is different.
    The :math:`S_l` computation in Chan is given as :math:`\sqrt{\frac{N-1}{l-1}}` for :math:`l > 2`.

ps0:
  desc: >
    Initial pseudo off-wall spacing.
    This spacing **must** be less than or equal to ``s0``.
    This is actual spacing the hyperbolic scheme uses.
    The solver may take many pseudo steps before the first real grid level at ``s0``.
    This is computed internally if a non-positive value is provided.

pGridRatio:
  desc: >
    The ratio between successive levels in the pseudo grid.
    This will be typically somewhere between ~1.05 for large grids to 1.2 for small grids.
    This number is **not** the actual grid spacing of the final grid; that spacing ratio is computed and displayed at the beginning of a calculation.
    The ``pGridRatio`` **must** be smaller than that number.
    This is computed internally if a non-positive value is provided.

epsE:
  desc: >
    The explicit smoothing parameter.
    See the :ref:`Theory<pyhyp_theory>` section for more information.
    Typical values are approximately 1.0. Increasing the explicit smoothing may result in a smoother grid, at the expense of orthogonality.
    If the geometry is very sharp corners, too much explicit smoothing will cause the solver to rapidly "soften" the corner and the grid will fold back on itself.
    In concave corners, additional smoothing will prevent lines from crossing (avoiding negative cells).

epsI:
  desc: >
    Implicit smoothing parameter.
    See the :ref:`Theory<pyhyp_theory>` section for more information.
    Typical values are from 2.0 to 6.0.
    Generally increasing the implicit coefficient results in a more stable solution procedure.
    Usually this value should be twice the explicit smoothing parameter.

theta:
  desc: >
    Kinsley-Barth coefficient See the :ref:`Theory<pyhyp_theory>` section for more information.
    Only a single theta value is used for both directions.
    Typical values are ~2.0 to ~4.0.

volCoef:
  desc: >
    Coefficient used in point-Jacobi local volume smoothing algorithm.
    Typically this value is 0.16 and need not be modified.
    Use more ``volSmoothIter`` for stronger local smoothing.

volBlend:
  desc: >
    The global volume blending coefficient.
    See the :ref:`Theory<pyhyp_theory>` section for more information.
    This value will typically be very small, especially if you widely varying cell sizes.
    Typical values are from ~0 to 0.001.

volSmoothIter:
  desc: >
    The number of point-Jacobi local volume smoothing iterations to perform.
    Typical values are ~5 to ~25.

volSmoothSchedule:
  desc: >
    If provided, use a user-supplied volume smoothing schedule.

kspRelTol:
  desc: >
    Tolerance for the solution of the linear system at each iteration.
    Typically :math:`1\times 10^{-8}` is sufficient.
    Very difficult cases may benefit from a tighter convergence tolerance.

kspMaxIts:
  desc: >
    Maximum number of iterations to perform for each step.
    The default should be sufficient for most cases.

kspSubspaceSize:
  desc: >
    Size of the ksp subspace.
    Very large and difficult problems may benefit from a larger subspace size.

writeMetrics:
  desc: >
    Flag to write the mesh gradients to the solution file.
    This option should only be used for debugging purposes.

outputType:
  desc: >
    Output format for the volume mesh.
  cgns: CGNS format
  plot3d: PLOT3D format

outputFile:
  desc: >
    Output filename.
    If None, an automatic filename will be generated by appending "_hyp" to the input filename.
