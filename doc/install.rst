Installation 
=============

Prerequisites
------------- 

pyHyp depends heavily on other packages to do much of the underlying
"heavy lifting". The following external components are required for
pyHyp:

- CGNS Libarary
- PETSc

See the MDO Lab installation guide `here <https://mdolab-mach-aero.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/installInstructions/install3rdPartyPackages.html#installthirdpartypackages>`_ for the supported versions and installation instructions.

.. NOTE:: A working MPI is not strictly required. However, in most
   cases PETSc should be configured with MPI.

Compilation 
------------ 
pyHyp follows the standard MDO Lab build procedure.
To start, first clone the repo. For stability we recommend checking out a tagged release.

Next, find a configuration file close to your current setup in ``config/defaults`` and copy it to ``config/config.mk``.
For example:

.. prompt:: bash

    cp config/defaults/config.LINUX_GFORTRAN_OPENMPI.mk config/config.mk

If you are a beginner user installing the packages on a Linux desktop, 
you should use the ``config.LINUX_GFORTRAN_OPENMPI.mk`` versions of the configuration 
files. The ``config.LINUX_INTEL.mk`` versions are usually used on clusters.

Once you have copied the config file, compile pyHyp by running:

.. prompt:: bash

    make

If everything was successful, the following lines will be printed to
the screen (near the end)::

   Testing if module hyp can be imported...
   Module hyp was successfully imported.

Finally, install the Python interface with:

.. prompt:: bash

    pip install .

Testing Your Installation
-------------------------

To test your installation, you can run the regression tests.
Running the tests requires additional dependencies.
Check if you have these installed by running:

.. prompt:: bash

    pip install .[testing]

Once you have the necessary dependencies, download the reference mesh files:

.. prompt:: bash

    ./reg_tests/ref/get-ref-files.sh

Then, in the root directory, run:

.. prompt:: bash

    testflo -v
